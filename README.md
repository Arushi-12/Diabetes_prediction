# Diabetes_prediction
This project focuses on predicting the diabetes onset utilizing a dataset comprising over 800 entries. In this project, we applied four machine learning models: Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Each model was trained and evaluated to assess its effectiveness in predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on various health metrics and indicators. The project aimed to explore and compare the performance of these algorithms in order to identify the most accurate predictive model for this critical health condition.

The accuracy was as mentioned:
1. Random Forest : 0.7677
2. Decision Tree : 0.7323
3. XGBoost : 0.7402
4. Support Vector Machine : 0.7402

This shows that Random Forest is the best model as it provides the maximum accuracy.
